# factoring

use 'eras' and then 'division' to make a list of primes needed by 'trial_div.py'

make_keys.py takes a command line argument to make the necessary information to
perform encryption via modular exponentiation. it uses the Miller-Rabin 
primality test

factor.py uses Pollards-rho to factor numbers
